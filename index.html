            <p>Hey there! If you wanted to learn a few things about me then you came to the right place. My name is Yobany but most people call me Yobo. How I got that nickname is a long story and if you are wondering how to pronounce my real name, it's pronounced (Yo-Bah-Knee). I was born 22 years ago. For 22 years I have lived in a small town named Salisbury but fortunately have been able to travel to many other places around the country.</p>
            <p>I am currently a graphic designer at Fisher Athletic, working to make a transition into the world of coding. While I do enjoy working as a graphic designer, I want to expand my skills and have more to offer as an employee. A few random facts about me are that I love playing sports, watching movies, traveling, being outdoors, and helping out at my church.</p>
